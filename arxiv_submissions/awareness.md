## 1. GENOME THEORY FRAMEWORK (1202 lines)

### Cellular Information Architecture

- Approximately 75% of genetic material remains unaccessed during normal cellular operation
- Cellular function depends predominantly on inherited, non-genomic information architectures

### DNA Supremacy Multicellularity Prevention Theorem

- If DNA served as primary operational control system, multicellular organisms could not have evolved
- Any cellular problem would be resolvable through genetic pathway restarting
- Immortal single cells would have no evolutionary pressure toward multicellularity
- Perfect genetic repair mechanisms would eliminate aging and death
- Multicellular cooperation would provide no advantage over optimized individuals
